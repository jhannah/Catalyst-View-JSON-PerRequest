  - Shorten the response helpers and new helpers to make the common
    patten of detaching on response easier.
  - change 'send' to 'response' since I think its less deceptive ('send'
    didn't actually send anything it just set the response.)  This is a
    breaking change if you used the send method (change to response or
    use a helper).
  - added a 'process' method to be more compatible with current practice
    so this can work with the 'RenderView' action class, for example.
